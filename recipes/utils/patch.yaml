# Because there is no suitable stand-alone package of the native windows support GNU Patch tool we
# reuse the one which comes with the Tool Windows For Git. This tool is a mandatory tool which
# must be installed on every developer and CI host machine. The plugin 'patch' stored under
# 'plugins' is a string parser which searches the patch.exe executable in the root directory of
# Windows For Git and returns the path to it if found.
